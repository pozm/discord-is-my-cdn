# discord-is-my-cdn

uploads all files in a directory (and sub direcories) and makes a json file with the links to the images.

This allows you to have discord as your own cdn!!!!

basic upload rates for discord are 7mb upload unless you have nitro.

so keep that in mind when uploading

and this project is used for educational purposes, it is not my fault if your discord account gets terminated

if you're going to use, you probably want to use a vpn

# discord-is-my-cdn

uploads all files in a directory (and sub direcories) and makes a json file with the links to the images.

This allows you to have discord as your own cdn!!!!

basic upload rates for discord are 7mb upload unless you have nitro.

so keep that in mind when uploading

and this project is used for educational purposes, it is not my fault if your discord account gets terminated

if you're going to use, you probably want to use a vpn

## how to use

compile it urself
and run the executable with -h
it will tell u how to use

## fetch all messageds from channel
if u accidentally kill the program or it stops running for some reason
you can resume it by providing a channel id with the offset which you were on.

if all of them are uploaded and you don't have an out.json in your CWD
then you can run it with the -f flag to fetch all the images and make the out.json
